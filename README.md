## About us
In the post-Covid 19 era, people around the world are eager to travel. And as people tried to socialise and reduce boredom during the lockdown period, social media plays an important role in bringing social interactions online. TrailBlazers is a captivating social media app designed specifically for passionate travellers who enjoys sharing their travel experiences with their families and friends through an engaging gamified system whereby users gain experience points(xp) through their activities in the app. Our aim is to create a vibrant environment for like-minded travellers to share their invaluable experiences and interact with each other. 

## Features
TrailBlazers allows users to post travel related picture and tag their posts with labels such as ‘History’, ‘Food’, ‘Scenery’, etc. The main feature of TrailBlazers is that users gain experience points by completing missions such as ‘Posting 4 food-related posts in a row’ or ‘Exploring 5 friends’ ‘scenic’ posts in Japan’. Users level-up once their experience point reaches a certain amount.
Their experience points, levels of achievements and progress of their mission completed will be displayed in their profile page.
